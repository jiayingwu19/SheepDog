## Abstract

It is commonly perceived that fake news and real news exhibit distinct writing styles, such as the use of sensationalist versus objective language. However, we emphasize that style-related features can also be exploited for style-based attacks. Notably, the advent of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) has empowered malicious actors to mimic the style of trustworthy news sources, doing so swiftly, cost-effectively, and at scale. Our analysis reveals that LLM-camouflaged fake news content significantly undermines the effectiveness of state-of-the-art text-based detectors (up to 38% decrease in F1 Score), implying a severe vulnerability to stylistic variations. To address this, we introduce SheepDog, a style-robust fake news detector that prioritizes content over style in determining news veracity. SheepDog achieves this resilience through (1) LLM-empowered news reframings that inject style diversity into the training process by customizing articles to match different styles; (2) a style-agnostic training scheme that ensures consistent veracity predictions across style-diverse reframings; and (3) content-focused veracity attributions that distill content-centric guidelines from LLMs for debunking fake news, offering supplementary cues and potential interpretability that assist veracity prediction. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks demonstrate SheepDog's style robustness and adaptability to various backbones.

## Requirements
```
python==3.7.0
numpy==1.22.4
torch==1.10.0+cu111
transformers==4.13.0
```

## Data
Our work is based on the `PolitiFact` and `GossipCop` datasets from the [FakeNewsNet benchmark](https://github.com/KaiDMML/FakeNewsNet), and the `LUN` dataset from [(Rashkin et al., 2017)](https://aclanthology.org/D17-1317.pdf). 

We provide the data files utilized for training and evaluating SheepDog under `data/`. In our data files, the label `0` represents real news, and the label `1` represents fake news.

**Original Unaltered Training / Test Articles**

The `.pkl` files under `data/news_articles/` contain the unaltered news article texts. Please refer to Section 6.1.1 of our paper for more details.

**Adversarial Test Sets**

The `.pkl` files under `data/adversarial_test/` contain the four adversarial test sets under LLM-empowered style attacks, denoted as A through D. Please refer to Section 4.1 and Table 4 of our paper for a detailed formulation.

**LLM-Empowered News Reframings**

The `.pkl` files under `data/reframings/` contain the style-diverse reframings of training articles. Please refer to Section 5.1 of our paper for detailed descriptions.  

**Content-Focused Veracity Attributions**

The `.pkl` files under `data/veracity_attributions/` contain the content-focused veracity attributions of training articles. Here, each article is assigned 4 binary labels according to the following 4 attributions: (1) lack of credible sources, (2) false or misleading information, (3) biased opinion, and (4) inconsistencies with reputable sources. Please refer to Section 5.3 of our paper for detailed descriptions. 


## Run SheepDog
 

Start training with the following command:

```bash
sh train.sh
```

Model checkpoints will be saved under `checkpoints/`, and results will be saved under `logs/`. 

Additionally, under `logs/logs_archive_all4_adv/`, we provide archived experiment logs for SheepDog on both the original test set and adversarial test sets A-D.
